Final CW: implementation of a Powergrab game 

The task is to develop an autonomous (“smart”) component which is to play against a human component in a location-based strategy game. The smart component is an au- tonomous drone which competes against a human player who is acting as the pilot of a remote-controlled (“dumb”) drone which moves only in response to directions from the pilot.

You are to develop a simulation framework which demonstrates two versions of an automated drone which plays the PowerGrab game as though it was playing against a human player. The first version has some specific limitations and is stateless; this version is suitable for playing against a novice human player. The second version does not have these limitations and is stateful; this version is suitable for playing against an expert human player. A better implementation of the stateful drone is one which collects more coins while still keeping its runtime modest.
